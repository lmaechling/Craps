INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

This is a nice little version of the Craps game, Lily.
You executed the rules of the game just as they should be,
and there's a nice flow when I'm playing.

You made especially good use of static methods ("helper
methods") in your main program--that was nicely done. By
convention, the main() program that runs the game is almost
always placed at the bottom of the class, rather than at
the top as you did. The program runs just fine, of course,
but human readers--including myself--are looking for that 
main program at the bottom. It's only an issue when you have
lots of static methods in the main as you do in this game.

You didn't get the chance to implement the "default Y/N"
feature as described in the project handout. You should
definitely figure out how to do that, as that will make
your game flow even better.

For now, however, this is pretty darn good!

SCORE: 48/50
